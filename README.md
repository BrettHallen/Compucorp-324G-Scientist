# Compucorp 324G Scientist
This information is based on the 324G calculator I have in my possession.  It will be relevant to other 320-series calculators to varying degrees.<br>

This calculator was also sold under other manufacturers' branding:
- Monroe
- Ricoh (as the X822)
- IME
- Sumlock Anita

## Power
My 324G came with a 240VAC (Australian) power supply that output an unregulated 11VDC (no load).<br>

It was originally designed to take four D-size NiCd rechargeable batteries.  Probably not a good idea to use non-rechargeable batteries if you are connecting the AC power adaptor.<br>

I have confirmed that the calculator looks to run okay on 5VDC (i.e. USB) consuming just over 1A.  I created a USB-to-2.1mm plug to confirm.

## [Integrated Circuits](/ICs)
Information about the ICs used in the calculator.

## [Keyboard](/Keyboard)
Information about the keyboard matrix.

## [KiCad](/KiCad)
KiCad format schematics for the calculator, based on my 324G.<br>

Note that these will likely be incomplete for a long time (forever) depending on what time/interest I have to trace the circuitry.<br>

My main target at the moment is the keyboard and Scan board due to the display issues I have.<br>

## [Manuals](/Manuals)
Any relevant manuals I might come across.

## [Panaplex II](/Panaplex_II_Display)
Information about the Burroughs Panaplex II display used in the calculators.<br>

The particular model is the 16 digit BR 16252.  On the 324G, at least, only 15 digits are really used (I think).  The 16th (first on left) is only used for a negative sign (?).<br>

Additional information about the Scan board.

Schematics I've generated from KiCad.<br>
